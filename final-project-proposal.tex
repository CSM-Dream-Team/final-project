\section{Introduction}

VR Technology has been developing rapidly in the 21st century. Current solutions
such as Unity attempt to use old programming languages and paradigms to
implement VR environments and thus limit developers' abilities to create new and
unique environments. With every cutting edge technology, new paradigms and
design patterns must be invented. This project intends to explore and implement
these paradigms and design patterns.

\section{Objectives}

The goal of this project is to experiment with a variety of paradigms and design
patterns to see which work best for implementing VR environments. To do this, we
will implement four different VR environments where users can move around and
interact with a variety of virtual objects. Each team member will build one
environment individually and the fourth will be built by the whole team and will
connect the individually-built environments.

\subsection{Environments and Interactions}
These are the concepts for our four environments and the interactions that can
occur in each environment:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item [Sumner] ``Snowflakes'' --- a winter-themed environment where users
        can create their own structures by manipulating snow blocks.
    \item [Robbie] ``Lets get Physical'' --- an environment where you can throw
        lots of objects around and see them interact in a physically-accurate
        manner.
    \item [Sam] ``Workbench'' --- a workbench where you can construct your own
        virtual objects from a variety of parts.
    \item [Team] ``VRsh'' --- a VR shell where users can interact with a variety
        of widgets as well as open other programs (environments).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{C-MAPP Event Readiness}
Our goal is to have this project ready for the C-MAPP event in January. To do
this, we must have a finished product and report by the end of this semester.

\section{Plan of Action}

This project will have four main stages that correlate with the due dates for
the individual assignments and the final project milestones.

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item [10/03] \textbf{Individual Assignments} --- Building the individual
        environments
    \item [11/03] \textbf{Milestone I} --- Building the VRsh environment
    \item [11/17] \textbf{Milestone II} --- Integrating the VRsh and individual
        environments
    \item [12/08] \textbf{Final Code Submission} --- Final touches to the VRsh
        environment.
\end{enumerate}

In addition to the above code submissions, we will also produce a final report
along with the Final Code Submission describing the work that we did and the
lessons we learned while implementing the project.

\section{References and Dependencies}

Because of the performance requirements and complexity of virtual reality software,
we decided to use the Rust programming language for all the projects in this 
independent study.

Our individual and final projects will all be built using our own shared, open-source
library called ``flight'', which will be continually updated to reflect what we learn 
while developing these projects. As of writing, flight incorporates our own VR hardware
interface, several custom rendering environments, mesh manipulation tools, and a few 
asset loading utilities.

Although most of the planned features of our shell can be implemented using the 
Rust standard libraries, there are several other tools that we will be depending on. 
The most notable are gfx (a GPU graphics wrapper), nalgebra (vector and matrix math),\
ncollide (geometric operations such as collisions and intersections), nphysics (physics
engine), OpenVR (Valve's VR hardware SDK), image (raster image loader), and futures
(asynchronous events). With the exception of OpenVR, all these libraries can be found on 
\texttt{crates.io}.
