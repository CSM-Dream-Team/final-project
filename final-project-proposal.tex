\section{Introduction}

The goal of our final project is to create a set of virtual environments where
users can move around and interact with a variety of virtual objects. There will
be four environments. Each team member will build one environment individually
and the fourth will be built by the whole team and will connect the
individually-built environments.

\section{Objectives}

\subsection{Environments and Interactions}
These are the concepts for our four environments and the interactions that can
occur in each environment:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item [Sumner] ``Snowflakes'' --- a winter-themed environment where users
        can create their own structures by manipulating snow blocks.
    \item [Robbie] ``Lets get Physical'' --- an environment where you can throw
        lots of objects around and see them interact in a physically-accurate
        manner.
    \item [Sam] ``Workbench'' --- a workbench where you can construct your own
        virtual objects from a variety of parts.
    \item [Team] ``VRsh'' --- a VR shell where users can interact with a variety
        of widgets as well as open other programs (environments).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{C-MAPP Event Readiness}
Our goal is to have this project ready for the C-MAPP event in January. To do
this, we must have a finished product and report by the end of this semester.
