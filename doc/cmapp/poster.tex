                \begin{block}{Exploration \& Goals}

                    We set out to find a system that provides a modern, fast,
                    and practical approach to virtual reality development.
                    Specifically, we needed a framework which met the
                    following criteria:

                    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=8.75cm, labelsep=1cm]

                        \item[\textbf{Performant}] VR requires at least 90
                            frames per second to run smoothly. Low frame rates
                            can cause users to experience headaches and nausea
                            faster than when at high frame rates~\cite{irisVR}.
                            This requires VR programs to be highly optimized and
                            multi-threadable.

                        \item[\textbf{Natural}] VR enables new user interfaces
                            where components are organized within a 3D space. We
                            wanted such components to be first class.

                        \item[\textbf{Flexible}] We need a general purpose user
                            interface toolkit designed specifically for VR.

                        \item[\textbf{Modular}] We need a toolkit which does
                            not include unnecessary features, but is extensible
                            with modular components.

                    \end{enumerate}

                    Over the course of many months, we explored several existing
                    VR frameworks and application architectures. We determined
                    that none of them meet our criteria for VR development.

                    We created our own user interface and rendering framework, 
                    \textbf{flight}, which addresses the problems that we've 
                    encountered during our exploration. We intially made use
                    of the immediate mode program architecture because of its
                    flexibility and extensibility, but repeatedly ran into the
                    following problem:

                    \begin{quote}

                        \textbf{There are some questions about the state of the
                        system which cannot be answered until all system
                        elements have ``reported'' their state.}

                    \end{quote}

                    To solve this problem, we created a powerful new program
                    architecture called \textbf{Deferred Immediate Mode (DIM)}.
                    The DIM architecture enabled us to meet all of our goals for
                    effective VR application development. 
                    
                    Adding deferrability to the classic immediate mode architecture 
                    retained flexibility while solving our issues with interdependent
                    user interface elements.

                \begin{block}{Flight}
                    \setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}

                    Our virtual reality toolkit, called flight, features high
                    level abstractions for interacting with VR hardware, a
                    state-of-the-art real-time rendering engine, asset loading tools,
                    and a selection of built-in UI elements. Flight is designed 
                    from the ground up to be performant, general, and modular.

                    Our final project demonstrates the results of using DIM to
                    implement a complex VR application. The environment
                    currently provides these features:
                    \begin{itemize}

                        \item \textbf{Modularity:} Each part of the application
                            is its own isolated module that can be modified and
                            even turned off without interfering with other
                            modules.
                            \begin{figure}[H]
                                \begin{subfigure}{0.5\linewidth}
                                    \centering
                                    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{../report/screenshots/toggle_a.jpg}
                                    \caption{Before}
                                \end{subfigure}%
                                \begin{subfigure}{0.5\linewidth}

                            \end{figure}

                        \item \textbf{Inter-Application Physics:} Althogh each
                            application is in a seprate module, DIM allows them
                            to interact seemlessly. For example, Mjolnir can hit
                            snowblocks.

                        \item \textbf{Yanking, Grabbing, and Pointing:} All
                            elements which can be grabbed, yanked, or pointed at
                            are manipulated using a common, intuitive user
                            interface scheme.
