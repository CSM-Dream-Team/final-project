Last semester we completed an independent study in Virtual Reality with Dr.
Paone. We created our own VR toolkit from the ground up with an innovative new
program architecture.

Our toolkit features state-of-the-art real-time rendering and has allowed us to
create a beautiful VR application that features real-time, interactive physics.

We have the VR equipment here, so stop by and try it out! We think you will be
impressed.
