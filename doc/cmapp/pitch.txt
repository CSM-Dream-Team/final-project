Last semester we completed an independent study in virtual reality with Dr.
Paone. We hoped to explore new ways of interacting with computers and solving
problems, but we quickly discovered that there was no way to do that using the
tools we had avalible. *pause* So we built our own tools! Over the course of
several months we built a state-of-the-art graphics engine and graphical
interface toolkit. To solve the problems we encountered, we also developed a
new type of software architecture.

We have a really cool demo set up, and you should all come check it out!
